A file manager using bash

### Usage
- . ./main.sh

as of now script must be sourced

### To-Do:
- [x] Implement basic file manager
- [x] add support for basic color to diff b/w dirs and file
- [ ] support for toggling display of hidden files
- [ ] support for search

### Bugs
- japanese characters seem to cause malloc errors (size issues??)
